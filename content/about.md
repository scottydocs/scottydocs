My name is **James Scott** and Iâ€™m a contract technical writer based in London, UK. After graduating from the University of Leicester with a degree in English literature, I became a journalist and worked for newspapers in Kent for six years before moving into technical writing.

I have worked with engineering teams in FinTech, the hospitality sector, AIOps (Artifical Intelligence for IT operations) and Android development. 

I have spoken at two of the largest technical writing conferences in Europe: **API the Docs** in London (November 2018) and **Write the Docs** in Prague (September 2019).
